Make-n-Paint
============

Make-n-Paint is a concept for a web service for families that would allow kids to customize toys, print them on a 3D printer and paint them using sharpies or acrylics.

## What is left to do?

Pretty much everything. This prototype is mockup of what the final web app might look like. Making
this work would require a slicer capable of using surface textures. This capability is currently
beyond the realm of any present slicer. Textures even preclude the use of the STL files that are
now the industry standard in 3D printing.

## Rookie coding advisory:

This was one of my very first webapp and THREE.js experiments. The code could use a lot of clean up.
It also uses JQuery, which I have banished from more recent efforts as an insult to good coding taste.
